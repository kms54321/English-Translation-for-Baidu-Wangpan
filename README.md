Baidu Netdisk / Cloud app English translation files

It's far from perfect: the layout is screwy in places, and as the translations are from google, they are also somewhat screwy. 
But it's definitely functional.

Thanks to zeffy for his/her panyi.exe, which simplifies the process of inserting translations.
This fork is for the purpose of distributing updates for the panyi.ini and DuiStringTable.xml files. 

Instructions

 - download panyi.exe from zeffy/panyi repo
 - download panyi.ini and DuiStringTable.xml from this repo
 - copy panyi.exe and panyi.ini to \AppData\Roaming\baidu\BaiduNetdisk
 - run panyi.exe
 - copy DuiStringTable.xml to \AppData\Roaming\baidu\BaiduNetdisk\skin
 - open duiengineskin.zip
 - go to the xml directory
 - replace the DuiStringTable.xml file in the zip archive with the downloaded english version
