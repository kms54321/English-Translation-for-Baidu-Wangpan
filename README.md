Baidu Netdisk / Cloud app English translation files

It's far from perfect: the layout is screwy in places, and as the translations are from google, they are also somewhat screwy. 
But it's definitely functional.

Thanks to zeffy for his/her panyi.exe, which simplifies the process of inserting translations. Unfortunately zeffy's repo no longer exists, so I've posted panyi.exe and its instructions here. 

This fork is for the purpose of distributing updates for the panyi.ini and DuiStringTable.xml files. 

Instructions

 - download panyi.exe, panyi.ini and DuiStringTable.xml
 - copy panyi.exe and panyi.ini to \AppData\Roaming\baidu\BaiduNetdisk
 - run panyi.exe
 - copy DuiStringTable.xml to \AppData\Roaming\baidu\BaiduNetdisk\skin
 - open duiengineskin.zip
 - go to the xml directory
 - replace the DuiStringTable.xml file in the zip archive with the downloaded english version
